A fast, low-overhead, Ed25519 signature verification library for the Solana SVM.

**Why brine-ed25519?**

Solana provides an [Ed25519 pre-compile](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/blob/master/sdk/src/ed25519_instruction.rs) program for signature verification—but it comes with several downsides:

- ❌ Requires the `instruction_sysvar` to be passed into your program
- ❌ Charges **5000 lamports per signature**
- ❌ Only verifies signatures on data hardcoded into the transaction
- ❌ Cannot be used with dynamically generated data inside your program

**brine-ed25519** solves all of that:

- ✅ Verifies Ed25519 signatures **within the program**  
- ✅ Fully supports dynamically generated messages  
- ✅ Only about **~30,000 compute units**
- ✅ No extra lamports required

---

## Example: Verifying a Signature

```rust
use brine_ed25519::sig_verify;

let pubkey: [u8; 32] = [...];
let sig: [u8; 64] = [...];
let message = b"hello world";

sig_verify(&pubkey, &sig, message)?;
```

Returns `Ok(())` if valid, or `Err(SignatureError)` if the signature is invalid.


## Performance

| Function     | CU Used (approx) |
|--------------|------------------|
| `sig_verify` | ~30,000          |

Measured on-chain using `solana_program::log::sol_log_compute_units()`.


## Features

- Uses `curve25519_syscalls`  
- Drops in easily to any Solana smart contract  
- Verifies dynamically created payloads  

Signature verification roughly follows [RFC 8032](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8032), with adaptations from:


## Usage

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
brine-ed25519 = "0.1.0"
```


## Tests

Includes test vectors from RFC 8032, as well as custom positive/negative test cases.

Run locally with:

```bash
cargo test
```


## Audit and Peer Reviews

This implementation is pulled from [code-vm](https://github.com/code-payments/code-vm) (MIT-licensed), which was written and maintained by the author of this crate.

- ✅ Reviewed as part of the [code-vm](https://github.com/code-payments/code-vm) audit by [OtterSec](https://osec.io)  
- ✅ Peer reviewed by [@stegaBOB](https://github.com/stegaBOB) and [@deanmlittle](https://github.com/deanmlittle)  

Big thanks to both reviewers for helpful suggestions and CU reductions!


## Why “brine”?

“Brine” evokes salt water — a precise solution. The name reflects a design focused on _precision_, _fluidity_, and _minimal bloat_ — ideal for constrained environments.
